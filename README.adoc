== Section 01

.Comparison between Models
[%header,cols=3*]
|===
|Datacenter Traditional
|CloudVM EC2 Model
|Serverless (Lambda/Fargate)

|We Must manage everything related to Datacenter, spend money on every new improvement, hard to control the main problem that is wasted resources
|Datacenter costs are too reduced, you need to manage the virtualization to serve the traffic appropriately, in this model there is a possibility of waste resources
|Cost-effective, and no server management is the main concern in this scenario, nothing about infra/hardware/traffic. just concern in your buzz requirements, but there are scenarios where the cost can be increased much more than virtualization,

|Compute
|Storage
|Integration, Analytics

|Lambda and Fargate
|S3, EBS, DynamoDb, Aurora RDS
|API Gateway, SQS, Step-functions SNS etc

=== Some Lambda Details

* Can choose from 128mb to 10GB, with CPU and Network allocated proportionally and 15min runtime
* Can be invoked synchronous (e.g; API) or asynchronous (e.g; SQS, S3)
* Inherent integration with other AWS services
* Lambdas definitely aren't the silver bullet for all solutions
