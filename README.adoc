.Comparison between Models
[%header,cols=3*]
|===
|Datacenter Traditional
|CloudVM EC2 Model
|Serverless (Lambda/Fargate)

|We Must manage everything related to Datacenter, spend money on every new improvement, hard to control the main problem that is wasted resources
|Datacenter costs are too reduced, you need to manage the virtualization to serve the traffic appropriately, in this model there is a possibility of waste resources
|Cost-effective, and no server management is the main concern in this scenario, nothing about infra/hardware/traffic. just concern in your buzz requirements, but there are scenarios where the cost can be increased much more than virtualization,

=== Some Lambda Details

* Can choose from 128mb to 10GB, with CPU and Network allocated proportionally and 15min runtime
* Can be invoked synchronous (e.g; API) or asynchronous (e.g; SQS, S3)
* Inherent integration with other AWS services
* Lambdas definitely aren't the silver bullet for all solutions
* Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers
* With lambda, you can run the code for virtually any type of application or backend serviceâ€”all with zero administration
* Upload your code, and _Lambda_ takes care of everything required to run and scale your code with high availability
* You pay only for the compute time you consume


=== Test the 4Rules Yes for all of them

1. No Servers to provision or manager
2. Automatically scales with usage
3. Never pay for idle
4. Availability and fault tolerance built in

=== AWS API Gateway Components

.Gateway Lifecycle
image::thumb/pic/api-gtw-components.png[]

. _Usage Plan_, provides selected API clients with access to one or more deployed apis, with a usage plan we can configure throttling and quota limits
. _API Developer_, AWS account that owns an API Gateway deployment
. _App Developer_, An app creator who may or many not have an AWS account and interacts with API that you, app devs are your customers, API key
. _Resources & Methods_, (GET, POST) each method along with resources, are deployed to stages, with invoke url for each method under each resource in each stage
. Query String with _Mapping Request Template (Apache Velocity)_
. With alias in Lambdas, we can shift the traffic, using a combination of versionTest:${stageVariables.lambdaAlias}

==== Canary Deployment

* Basic idea API Gateway => API Stage => Lambda 1 (Base Version), with the stage's Request Distribution (calculated percentage of requests directed to Canary/Dev)

==== Gateway Endpoint Types

. _Edge Optimized_ designed to help you reduce client latency from anywhere on the Internet

.Gateway Edge Optimized
image::thumb/pic/edge-gateway-optimization.png[]

. _Regional_ designed to reduce latency when calls are made from the same region as the api

.Gateway Regional
image::thumb/pic/gateway-regional.png[]

.Gateway Regional and Route 53
image::thumb/pic/gateway-regional-route53.png[]

. _Private_ designed to expose APIs only inside your VPC

.Gateway Private
image::thumb/pic/gateway-private.png[]

==== POST API

* POST Resource mapped to Lambda

==== Query Param

[source,hcl-terraform]
----
 resource "aws_api_gateway_method" "example_api_method" {
      rest_api_id = "${aws_api_gateway_rest_api.example_api.id}"
      resource_id = "${aws_api_gateway_resource.example_api_resource.id}"
      http_method = "GET"
      authorization = "NONE"
      request_parameters = {
        "integration.request.querystring.account_id"=true
      }
}
----

==== Cross Account

To call a resource from a different account basic we need to copy the ARN,
_arn:aws:lambda:sa-east_1:41133459552890:function:helloWorldFromSecondAccount_ with permissions

.AWS Cloud 9 CLI deploying lambda with version and alias
[source,bash]
----
aws lambda add-permission --function-name \
"arn:aws:lambda:sa-east-1:87221112320:function:versionTest:${stageVariables:lambdaAlias}" \
--source-arn "arn:aws:execute-api:sa-east-1:87221112320:fq331sr24gwy/*/GET/" \

Or in Terraform
[source, hcl-terraform]
----
resource "aws_lambda_permission" "apigtw_lambda_permissionByInvoke" {
  action        = "lambda:InvokeFunction"
  function_name = "${module.lambda.lambda_function_name}"
  principal     = "apigateway.amazonaws.com"
  statement_id = "AllowAPIGatewayInvoke"
  #
  # The "/*/*" portion grants access from any method on any resource
  # within the API Gateway REST API.
  # In ad different account
  source_arn    = "${aws_api_gateway_rest_api.helloWorld_apiGateway.execution_arn}/*/*"
}
----

==== Lambda Alias and traffic Splitting (Canary Deployment)

We can split the traffic based on alias/version of your lambdas as demonstrated bellow

image:./thumb/pic/lambda_alias_splittraffic.png[]

[source,hcl-terraform]
----
resource "aws_lambda_alias" "test_lambda_alias" {
  name             = "my_alias"
  description      = "a sample description"
  function_name    = aws_lambda_function.lambda_function_test.arn
  function_version = "1"

  routing_config {
    additional_version_weights = {
      "2" = 0.5
    }
  }
}
----

==== Integration Types

* Lambda Function
* HTTP
* Mock
* AWS Service
* VPC Link

==== API Caching

[source, hcl-terraform]
----
resource "aws_api_gateway_integration" "MyDemoIntegration" {
  rest_api_id          = aws_api_gateway_rest_api.MyDemoAPI.id
  resource_id          = aws_api_gateway_resource.MyDemoResource.id
  http_method          = aws_api_gateway_method.MyDemoMethod.http_method
  type                 = "MOCK"
  cache_key_parameters = ["method.request.path.param"]
  cache_namespace      = "foobar"
  timeout_milliseconds = 29000

  request_parameters = {
    "integration.request.header.X-Authorization" = "'static'"
  }

  # Transforms the incoming XML request to JSON
  request_templates = {
    "application/xml" = <<EOF
{
   "body" : $input.json('$')
}
EOF
  }
}
----

==== Swagger and OpenAPI 3

* API as Code
* Human and machine-readable to create APIs
* Share APIs internally and externally
* Generates API documentation
* Supports Yaml and Json
* Now called "Open API Initiative"
* You can generate Swagger files for all your APIs in API Gateway, even if you created them console
* Recreate your APIs
* Enables you to use any API Management tool (NOT Locked in)
* Create standards for the APIs in your enterprise
* Documentation helps future developers

==== CORS & API Gateway

* Browser security feature that restricts cross-origin HTTP Request

* Simple
** Only for GET, HEAD and POST
** POST must include Origin header
** Request payload content type can be a text/plain, multipart/form-data, or application/x-www-form-urlencoded
** Request does not contain custom headers

* Non Simple
** All other cross origin HTTP Requests

.Custom Domain API Gateway

== Scaling Lambda

* Unreserved account concurrency up to 1K instances, this is for all lambdas in the same account, e.g.:, we've 10 lambdas in our account, but one of them hold-on 900, the other lambdas will need to share only the remains quota resources

* Reserved Concurrency means if I reserve 200 connections for one specific lambda will remain only 800 for all other lambdas

.Concurrency sample graph
image::thumb/pic/concurrency-8-provisioned-concurrency.png[]

* On Rate of scaling in zero to one thousand, in most of the cases, can't be in one second even if your lambda has an aggressive cold start, to sum up, _provisioned concurrency_ means, _pre-initialized execution environments, no cold-start or throttling due to super-fast scaling and AWS will keep assigned capacity "Warmed"_, the question here is, make sense to keep provisioned concurrency to lambda? is probably better a EC2(Fargate or EKS), isn't it?

.Provisioned Concurrency Pricing
|===
|Provisioned Concurrency |Price

|Provisioned Concurrency
|$0.000004167 for every GB-second
|Duration

|Requests
|$0.20 per 1M requests
|$0.000009722 for every GB-second
|===

.Provisioned Concurrency configuration

=== Lambda Layers

* Avoid duplicated buzz logic among lambdas

* Lets functions easily share code: upload layer once, reference within any function

* Layers can be anything as dependencies, training data, configuration files, etc

* Promote logic separation of responsibilities

* Get loaded with the function without additional execution latency

* To sum up, layers can simplify sharing and versioning common code deployed, 250 mb size limit (not recommended), and up to five layers per function

[%header,cols=2*]
|===
|To *DOs*
|Not To *DON'T's*

|Push shared code into discrete layers
|Don't push unnecessary stuff into the layer, don't treat it as dumpstar, it'll increase code loading time

|Version Layers and use to deploy across accounts
|

|Simplify your deployment management
|

=== RDS Proxy

* In a scenario with gateway lambda and spike traffic using rds proxy, we can struggle with a limited number of rds connections, orphan connections linger or db memory/cpu spent, and really lambdas can quickly exhaust the connection limit, a possible workaround is use RDS Proxy, it situates between lambda and rds instance

* RDS Proxy is a fully managed, highly available database proxy; it allows applications to share a pool of database connections, using secret management for db credentials
